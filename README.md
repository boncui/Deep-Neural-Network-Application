Integrated a deep neural network from scratch to accurately classify images of cats using matrix multiplication with forward and backward propagation, 
enabling precise predictions and computations to achieve 80% accuracy through extensive hyperparameter tuning.

#Project Description
"the final assignment in this course! In this notebook you will build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to the very important problem of classifying cat images from non-cat images.  :)"
In this project, I utilized and applied everything I learned so far from the course, ranging from logistic regression, activation functions, forward propogations, and backward progogations to classify images of cats
